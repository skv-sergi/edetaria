Add custom shipping methods to WooCommerce.

== Description ==

**Custom Shipping Methods for WooCommerce** plugin lets you add (multiple) custom shipping methods to WooCommerce.

In each custom shipping method's **cost calculation formula** you can use these shortcodes:

* **`[qty]`** - number of items (i.e. **quantity**) in cart,
* **`[cost]`** - total **cost** of items in cart,
* **`[weight]`** - total cart items **weight**,
* **`[volume]`** - total cart items **volume**,
* **`[fee]`** - percentage based **fees**,
* **`[round]`** - **rounding**.

In addition, for each custom shipping method, you can optionally set these **method availability** options:

* min and max cart **cost**,
* min and max cart **weight**,
* min and max cart **volume**,
* min and max cart **quantity**,
* required and excluded cart **products**,
* required and excluded cart **product categories**,
* required and excluded cart **product tags**.

Optionally costs can be added based on the **product shipping class**:

* costs per **product shipping class** and for **no shipping class**,
* **calculation type**: charge shipping per class or per order,
* **limits calculation**: check limits per class, per order or all.

Advanced options include **custom return URL** - it can be used instead of the standard "Order received" page.
